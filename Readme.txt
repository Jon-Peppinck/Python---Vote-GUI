About
-----
vote.py was created to determine how financial aid from the King of Codetopia should be divided. The residents in the region
will vote from three farms that they believe are in most need of aid. The King's aid will be split based
on the ratio of votes. The farms to select from are: Elif Farm, For Loop Range, and List Append Stud

vote.py is a graphical user interface that prompts the user to select one of the three farms they decide to vote for.
The total number of votes for each of the three farms will be displayed as the residents believe this is fairer.
It is to be noted that this program is planned to be conducted on a touchscreen device

Troubleshooting
---------------
This graphical user interface is quite simple in design and is intended for the residents of Codetopia
to have one vote each. To avoid voting more than one time by accident or purpose some implementation
procedures are recommended. Possible solutions may be: Public voting protocol, monitored voting,
device allowing only one vote per user, identification verification per vote, and other measures
deemed appropriate via the King and residents of Codetopia.

If any of the residents execute more than one vote it can be subtracted from the total vote at the end.
If the graphical user interface is accidently closed, the previously recorded number of votes can be 
added to the total votes

File Permissions - If you are denied access to reading, writing, or executing
vote.py - from the linux terminal you can type chmod a+r vote.py,
chmod a+w vote.py, or chmod a+x vote.py

Please ensure you are in the correct directory to access vote.py
